Decision Tree Classifier Project - Bank Marketing Dataset
This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A Decision Tree Classifier is implemented to achieve this goal.

🚀 Project Overview
The project covers the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder.

Model Training:
The data is split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Predictions are made on the test set.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Visualization:
Confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap.
The trained decision tree is visualized.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization libraries

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which includes demographic and behavioral data about customers contacted during a marketing campaign. The target variable is whether the customer subscribed to the product (y column).

🔍 Data Preprocessing
Label Encoding: Categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical form.
Feature Selection: All features except the target (y) are used for training the model.

🎯 Model Training and Evaluation
Model: A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the data to predict customer behavior.
Metrics:
Accuracy: How well the model predicts.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true vs. predicted values.

📈 Visualizations
Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into model performance.
Decision Tree Plot: Visualizes the trained decision tree, showing how decisions are made.
